# Introduction

The InfiUse Blog App is a comprehensive application that combines various functionalities, including blog creation, code sharing and collaboration, and an AI-powered chat assistant. The app leverages advanced technologies like large language models (LLMs) and APIs to provide an enhanced user experience.
Environment Setup

The project starts by loading environment variables, including the Groq API key and the Codestral API key. These keys are required for interacting with the respective AI services used throughout the application.
User Authentication
Before accessing the main features, users must authenticate themselves. The application provides a user authentication system with the following functionalities:

**Login:** Users can log in with their username and password.

**Registration:** New users can register by providing a username, password, security question, and answer.

**Forgot Password:** Users can reset their password by answering the security question associated with their account.

The user data is stored in a JSON file **(users_db.json)**, and various helper functions are provided to load, save, and authenticate users.

## Main Functionality

Once authenticated, users can access the main functionalities of the application through the main menu. The available options are:

### 1. Blog Creation

1. **Create Blog Post:** Users can create a new blog post by providing a title, keywords, and content. The content can be generated using an LLM (Groq or Mistral) based on the provided title and keywords.

2. **View Blog Posts:** Users can view a list of existing blog posts, including their titles, content, and creation timestamps.

3. **Edit Blogs:** Users can select an existing blog post and edit its title and content.

4. **Delete Blogs:** Users can delete an existing blog post by selecting it from a list.


### 2. Code Sharing and Collaboration

1. **Code Snippets Sharing:** Users can share code snippets by selecting a programming language and entering the code.

2. **Collaborative Coding:** Users can view shared code snippets, run the code, edit the code, and delete code snippets.

3. **Inspect and Run Code:** This functionality analyzes the code for errors and executes it, potentially using the Codestral API for code analysis and execution.

4. **Help:** A page dedicated to providing assistance (currently under development).


### 3. Chat

1. **AI Chat Conversation:** Users can engage in a conversational AI chat by asking questions and receiving responses generated by an LLM (Groq or Mistral). The conversation history is displayed, and users can continue the conversation.



## Additional Features

The application includes several additional features and functionalities:

1. **Coin System:** Users accumulate coins based on their actions within the application, such as creating blog posts or submitting code snippets. The coin count is displayed in the sidebar.

2. **Code Generation:** For blog posts related to technical topics, the application provides the option to generate code snippets based on the blog post title and content.

3. **Code Formatting:** The application formats code snippets for better readability and generates code titles using an LLM.

4. **Logout:** Users can log out of the application, clearing their session and authentication data.

## Technologies Used

The InfiUse Blog App is built using the following technologies:

1. **Python:** The project is written in Python programming language.

2. **Streamlit:** The application's user interface is developed using the Streamlit framework, which provides an interactive and reactive web interface.

3. **Groq:** The project utilizes the Groq AI service for language model capabilities, such as generating blog post content, analyzing code, and powering the chat assistant.
 
4. **Codestral API:** The Codestral API is used for code generation, analysis, and execution.

5. **JSON:** User data and code snippets are stored in JSON files for persistence.

6. **UUID:** The Python uuid module is used to generate unique identifiers for user keys.

7. **Datetime:** The datetime module is used for handling timestamps and date-time operations.

8. **LangChain:** The LangChain library is used for building and managing conversations with language models.

9. **StreamlitAce:** The streamlit-ace library is used for providing a code editor interface within the application.
